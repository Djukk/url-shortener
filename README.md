### URL Shortener
URL Shortener is a simple URL shortener built using the Gin Gonic framework, GORM and MySQL. Please do not use this repository to learn, this is my first Go project and it's likely filled with bad practices. 

### Installation 
Rename `.env.example` to `.env`, fill out all of the fields and run the project using `go run main.go`. If you want to build the package, simply run `go build`.
